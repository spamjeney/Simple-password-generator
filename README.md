# Simple password generator

This is a very simple password generator which is based on the rand() function of PHP.
The code generates three passwords with 128 bit of enthropy -- in all three cases the misreadable characters are eliminated.

1. The first one contains special characters, thus it is shorter (20 characters).

2. The second one contains only lowercase, uppercase and numeric characters, thus it must be longer (22 characters).

3. The third one is a sequence of hexadecimal characters (length of 32 characters).

## How to install

Put it into a directory of your choice, or rename as index.php, if you wish. No special requirements must be met.
